# track
audio plugin which acts as a mini DAW, as a workaround to track count limits in major DAWs

## About
**track is a free plugin developed as a workaround to track count limits in DAWs** (like Ableton Live Lite's 8 track limit)


To start using track, add the plugin to any track within your host DAWâ€”you now have a mini DAW in a plugin.
You can then create tracks to play audio clips, as well as hosting other plugins with delay compensation.

## Features
- **unlimited stereo audio tracks**, which can be nested using groups
- **drag and drop audio clips** (with basic clip manipulation features like splitting and trimming)
- **scanning and hosting plugins** for individual tracks and/or groups, with **delay compensation**
- **automation medium** from host DAW to plugins hosted inside of track

    </summary>

<br>

inside `JUCE/modules/juce_audio_processors/format_types/juce_VST3PluginFormat.cpp`, add the following code anywhere inside the `VST3PluginWindow` struct

```cpp
#if JUCE_LINUX
    void handleCommandMessage(int commandId) override {
        if (commandId == 420) {
            embeddedComponent.updateEmbeddedBounds();
        }
    }
#endif

```
</details>

### Compiling
#### Linux-based
run Make
```bash
$ make
```

#### Windows (Visual Studio)
- open `track.sln`
- Under Build, click Build Solution (or just do Ctrl+Shift+B)

### Running
**If you built a debug build**, move `track_artefacts/Debug/VST3/track.vst3` to the appropriate plugins folder for your DAW

otherwise, move `track_artefacts/Release/VST3/track.vst3` to the appropriate plugins folder for your DAW

then add track to any track in your DAW
